## Overview

lre-react is a library of reusable components tailored specifically to LRE Water use cases. The components are meant for use with React and are an extension of the [Material UI framework](https://material-ui.com/). This library has grown out of the LRE Starter kKt and is meant to compliment the Starter Kit as well as any other React project.
